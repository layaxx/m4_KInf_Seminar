  abstract = {Science communication has a number of bottlenecks that include the rising number of published research papers and its non-machine-accessible and document-based paradigm, which makes the exploration, reading, and reuse of research outcomes rather inefficient. Recently, Knowledge Graphs (KG), i.e., semantic interlinked networks of entities, have been proposed as a new core technology to describe and curate scholarly information with the goal to make it machine readable and understandable. However, the main drawback of the use of such a technology is that researchers are asked to manually annotate their research papers and add their contributions within the KGs. To address this problem, in this paper we propose SCICERO, a novel KG generation approach that takes in input text from research articles and generates a KG of research entities. SCICERO uses Natural Language Processing techniques to parse the content of scientific papers to discover entities and relationships, exploits state-of-the-art Deep Learning Transformer models to make sense and validate extracted information, and uses Semantic Web best practices to formally represent the extracted entities and relationships, making the written content of research papers machine-actionable. SCICERO has been tested on a dataset of 6.7M papers about Computer Science generating a KG of about 10M entities. It has been evaluated on a manually generated gold standard of 3,600 triples that cover three Computer Science subdomains (Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning) obtaining remarkable results.}

  abstract  = {We examine the capabilities of a unified, multi-task framework for three information extraction tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, and event extraction. Our framework (called DyGIE++) accomplishes all tasks by enumerating, refining, and scoring text spans designed to capture local (within-sentence) and global (cross-sentence) context. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results across all tasks, on four datasets from a variety of domains. We perform experiments comparing different techniques to construct span representations. Contextualized embeddings like BERT perform well at capturing relationships among entities in the same or adjacent sentences, while dynamic span graph updates model long-range cross-sentence relationships. For instance, propagating span representations via predicted coreference links can enable the model to disambiguate challenging entity mentions. Our code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/dwadden/dygiepp} and can be easily adapted for new tasks or datasets.}

  abstract  = {In recent years, we saw the emergence of several approaches for producing machine-readable, semantically rich, interlinked descriptions of the content of research publications, typically encoded as knowledge graphs. A common limitation of these solutions is that they address a low number of articles, either because they rely on human experts to summarize information from the literature or because they focus on specific research areas. In this paper, we introduce the Computer Science Knowledge Graph (CS-KG), a large-scale knowledge graph composed by over 350M RDF triples describing 41M statements from 6.7M articles about 10M entities linked by 179 semantic relations. It was automatically generated and will be periodically updated by applying an information extraction pipeline on a large repository of research papers. CS-KG is much larger than all comparable solutions and offers a very comprehensive representation of tasks, methods, materials, and metrics in Computer Science. It can support a variety of intelligent services, such as advanced literature search, document classification, article recommendation, trend forecasting, hypothesis generation, and many others. CS-KG was evaluated against a benchmark of manually annotated statements, yielding excellent results.},

  abstract  = {Scientific knowledge has been traditionally disseminated and preserved through research articles published in journals, conference proceedings, and online archives. However, this article-centric paradigm has been often criticized for not allowing to automatically process, categorize, and reason on this knowledge. An alternative vision is to generate a semantically rich and interlinked description of the content of research publications. In this paper, we present the Artificial Intelligence Knowledge Graph (AI-KG), a large-scale automatically generated knowledge graph that describes 820K research entities. AI-KG includes about 14M RDF triples and 1.2M reified statements extracted from 333K research publications in the field of AI, and describes 5 types of entities (tasks, methods, metrics, materials, others) linked by 27 relations. AI-KG has been designed to support a variety of intelligent services for analyzing and making sense of research dynamics, supporting researchers in their daily job, and helping to inform decision-making in funding bodies and research policymakers. AI-KG has been generated by applying an automatic pipeline that extracts entities and relationships using three tools: DyGIE++, Stanford CoreNLP, and the CSO Classifier. It then integrates and filters the resulting triples using a combination of deep learning and semantic technologies in order to produce a high-quality knowledge graph. This pipeline was evaluated on a manually crafted gold standard, yielding competitive results. AI-KG is available under CC BY 4.0 and can be downloaded as a dump or queried via a SPARQL endpoint.},

Our experimental results demonstrate that the combination of information from research KGs with existing state-of-the-art approaches is beneficial. Experimental results are presented for the STM-KG (STM: Science, Technology, Medicine), which is an automatically populated knowledge graph based on the scientific concepts extracted from papers of ten domains. The proposed approach outperforms the state of the art with a mean average precision of 20.6{\%} (+0.8) for the top-50 retrieved results.},

  abstract  = {Literature reviews have long played a fundamental role in synthesizing the current state of a research field. However, in recent years, certain fields have evolved at such a rapid rate that literature reviews quickly lose their relevance as new work is published that renders them outdated. We should therefore rethink how to structure and publish such literature reviews with their highly valuable synthesized content. Here, we aim to determine if existing Linked Data technologies can be harnessed to prolong the relevance of literature reviews and whether researchers are comfortable with working with such a solution. We present here our approach of "living literature reviews'' where the core information is represented as Linked Data which can be amended with new findings after the publication of the literature review. We present a prototype implementation, which we use for a case study where we expose potential users to a concrete literature review modeled with our approach. We observe that our model is technically feasible and is received well by researchers, with our "living'' versions scoring higher than their traditional counterparts in our user study. In conclusion, we find that there are strong benefits to using a Linked Data solution to extend the effective lifetime of a literature review.},

  abstract = { As the amount of scholarly communication increases, it is increasingly difficult for specific core scientific statements to be found, connected and curated. Additionally, the redundancy of these statements in multiple fora makes it difficult to determine attribution, quality and provenance. To tackle these challenges, the Concept Web Alliance has promoted the notion of nanopublications (core scientific statements with associated context). In this document, we present a model of nanopublications along with a Named Graph/RDF serialization of the model. Importantly, the serialization is defined completely using already existing community-developed technologies. Finally, we discuss the importance of aggregating nanopublications and the role that the Concept Wiki plays in facilitating it. }

Citation are described in terms of the factual and rhetorical relationships between citing publication and cited publication, the in-text and global citation frequencies of each cited work, and the nature of the cited work itself, including its publication and peer review status.

CiTO is written in the Web Ontology Language OWL, uses the namespace http://purl.org/net/cito/, and is available from http://purl.org/net/cito/. This site uses content negotiation to deliver to the user an OWLDoc Web version of the ontology if accessed via a Web browser, or the OWL ontology itself if accessed from an ontology management tool such as Prot{\'e}g{\'e} 4 (http://protege.stanford.edu/).
